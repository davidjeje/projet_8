# Project 8 Openclassrooms


**Symfony definition:**

> Symfony is a set of PHP components and a free MVC framework written in PHP. It provides flexible and adaptable features that facilitate and accelerate the development of a website.

**Requirements:**
*   Git
*   Local server with PHP
*   PHP 7.2 or Higher
*   Composer
*   Symfony

> Download composer:

Normally, PHP 7.2 or the latest version of PHP must already be installed on our working environment, as this is a prerequisite for installing composer and symfony.

Here are the commands to install Composer on our computer. We can install it the same way, whatever our operating system, as soon as PHP is installed:

    php -r "copy(https://getcomposer.org/installer, 'composer-setup.php');"
    php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') ===    '93b54496392c062774670ac18b134c3b3a95e5a5e5c8f1a9f115f203b75bf9a129d5daa8ba6a13e2cc8a1da0806388a8') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
    php composer-setup.php
    php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
  
Then quickly check that PHP and Composer are available in your command prompt:

    php -v
    composer –version

> Installation:

    git clone  https://github.com/davidjeje/projet_8
    cd projet_8
    composer install

## Before Starting the application 

For the application to access the database:

It will be necessary to parameterize the file .env which is at the root of the project. Then if you have a local server on your computer you can connect to the database of your choice. 

Example with mysql who is relational database management system :

    DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:@127.0.0.1:3306/projet8TodoList

## Install fixtures

    php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load

## Starting the application

If in production we use a web server like Apache or Nginx, in development, we can use the PHP local server. For this, the framework provides a dedicated console:
    php bin/console server:run

If the port is not busy, the application will be available at this address: 
<http://localhost:8000>
To stop this local server, use the command  Ctrl + C  in your command prompt.
